Example: \n\"filter\": \"sepia;invert;brightness(1.1);saturation(1.3);\"\n.  Default is \n\"\"\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndisable_nbsp\n\n\nboolean\n\n\nDisable the translation of spaces into \n&nbsp;\n.

Exporting BBCode is very similar to exporting HTML code.  But keep in mind, not all forums have all the BBCode support needed to view ExportHtml's BBCode format, so your mileage may vary.\n\n\nIf adding a command to the settings file, it goes under the \nbbcode_panel\n setting.

When the HTML is generated, the selected text will be underlined, and when the mouse hovers over them, a tooltip will appear with your comment.\n\n\n\n\nIn order to use annotations, you must enter into an \"Annotation Mode\".  This puts your file in a read only state.  At this point, you can select text and create annotations using the annotation commands provided.  When you leave the \"Annotation Mode\", all annotations will be lost.  So you must export before leaving annotation mode.\n\n\nYou can access the annotation commands from the command palette or from the context menu.\n\n\nThe commands are as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommand\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnable Annotation Mode\n\n\nTurn annotation mode on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisable Annotation Mode\n\n\nTurn annotation mode off.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnnotate Selection\n\n\nAnnotate the given selection (no multi-select support currently).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDelete Annotation(s)\n\n\nDelete the annotation region the the cursor resides in (multi-select support).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDelete All Annotations\n\n\nDelete all annotation regions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Annotation Comment\n\n\nShow the annotation comment of the region under the cursor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can navigate the annotations in the generated HTML by using a jump table.  You can show the jump table at any time by selecting the annotation button in the toolbar.  You can also click any annotation to show the jump table as well.  If it gets in the way, you can dock it in a different location.\n\n\n\n\nSettings File options\n\ue157\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParameter\n\n\nType\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nalternate_scheme\n\n\nstring\u00a0or\u00a0false\n\n\nDefines a default theme to be used if a theme is not specified in a command.

Pull requests are welcome for back-porting features, enhancements, or fixes to the old branch, but the content of the pull \nmust\n already exist on the main, actively developed branch.  I will not allow an older branch to exceed the main branch in regards to functionality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nST3\n\n\nFully supported and actively maintained.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContribution from the community is encouraged and can be done in a variety of ways:\n\n\n\n\nBug reports.\n\n\nReviewing code.\n\n\nCode patches via pull requests.\n\n\nDocumentation improvements via pull requests.\n\n\n\n\nBug Reports\n\ue157\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease \nread the documentation\n and \nsearch the issue tracker\n to try to find the answer to your question \nbefore\n posting an issue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen an issue is created, a \ntemplate\n will be shown, please fill out the appropriate sections. If the template is not followed, the issue will be marked \nInvalid\n and closed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen creating an issue on the repository, please provide as much info as possible:\n\n\n\n\nProvide environment information by running \nPreferences->Package Settings->ExportHtml->Support Info\n.  The information will be copied to the clipboard; paste the info in issue.\n\n\nErrors in console.\n\n\nDetailed description of the problem.\n\n\nExamples for reproducing the error.

When making a pull request, the tests will automatically be run, and the request must pass to be accepted.  You can (and should) run these tests before pull requesting.  If it is not possible to run these tests locally, they will be run when the pull request is made, but it is strongly suggested that requesters make an effort to verify before requesting to allow for a quick, smooth merge.\n\n\nRunning Validation Tests\n\ue157\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\nIf you are running Sublime on a macOS or Linux/Unix system, you run all tests by by running the shell script (assuming you have installed your environment fulfills all requirements below):\n\n\nchmod +x run_tests.sh\n./run_tests.sh\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are a couple of dependencies that must be present before running the tests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs \nST3\n is the only current, actively supported version, Python 3.3 must be used to validate the tests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnit tests are run with pytest (\npytest-dev/pytest\n).  You can install \npytest\n via:\n\n\npip install pytest\n\n\n\n\nThe tests should be run from the root folder of the plugin by using the following command:\n\n\npy.test .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinting is performed on the entire project with the following modules:\n\n\n\n\npycqa/flake8\n\n\npycqa/flake8-docstrings\n\n\nebeweber/flake8-mutable\n\n\ngforcada/flake8-builtins\n\n\npycqa/pep8-naming\n\n\n\n\nThese can be installed via:\n\n\npip install flake8\npip install flake8-docstrings\npip install flake8-mutable\npip install flake8-builtins\npip install pep8-naming\n\n\n\n\nLinting is performed with the following command:\n\n\nflake8 .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJavaScript files are linted with the \njshint\n module for \nnodejs\n.\n\n\n\n\nnodejs\n can be downloaded and installed from \nhttps://nodejs.org\n.\n\n\n\n\njshint\n can be installed with node's package manager called \nnpm\n. This example will illustrate how to install and use \njshint\n globally.  If you don't want to do it globally and know how to do it locally, feel free to that as well.\n\n\nInstall.\n\n\nnpm install -g jshint\n\n\n\n\nLinting is performed with the following command:\n\n\njshint .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDocumentation Improvements\n\ue157\n\n\nA ton of time has been spent not only creating and supporting this plugin, but also spent making this documentation.  If you feel it is still lacking, show your appreciation for the plugin by helping to improve the documentation.  Help with documentation is always appreciated and can be done via pull requests.  There shouldn't be any need to run validation tests if only updating documentation.\n\n\nYou don't have to render the docs locally before pull requesting, but if you wish to, I currently use a combination of \nmkdocs/mkdocs\n, the \nsquidfunk/mkdocs-material\n, and \nfacelessuser/pymdown-extensions\n to render the docs.  You can preview the docs if you install these two packages.  The command for previewing the docs is \nmkdocs serve\n from the root directory. You can then view the documents at \nlocalhost:8000\n.",
